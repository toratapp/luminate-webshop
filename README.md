Noroff school assignment, Front-end development. The assignment was to use React to build an eCom store.


## Description

On the Luminate webshop website you can view all products, see details about the products, add to cart and checkout. The cart icon shows how many items are in the cart and the cart page shows all of the products in the cart and the total price for all of the items. You can also fill out a contact form on the contact page. In this assignment I learned how to use React with Vite, Zustand for state management and Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for appearance.


## Built With

- Javascript framework: React + Vite
